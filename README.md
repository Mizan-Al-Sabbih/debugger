# Overview

Work in progress (not currently working, just created as a placeholder for npmjs.org/debugger). We'll be extracting the debugger logic we made for remote debugging our robots into a reusable module.

**Todo:**
  - [ ] Add cross platform shortcuts for reload and dev tools toggle as in [electron-debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-debug)
    - [ ] Make sure menu shows proper platform shortcut
